<!-- 1) In the DTD we cannot for example say that the route[@tag] has to be an integer, it has to be of type CDATA
        which isn't that specific especially if XML is suppose to to be a markup language
     2) The stop element occurs on its own and as an attribute of the direction element, but we can only specify it
        in the DTD only once
